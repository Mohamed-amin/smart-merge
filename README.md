# Merge 2 objects
Deep merge two objects properties.

# install
`npm install smart-merge` 

# Dependencies
there is Polyfill for `Object.assign()` to run the tests with Karma.
However to use it within your developing stack I figure that you have a transpilar or fallback for es6/es5 features, So I wouldn't like to polute  with more code or unneeded dependencies for such a small and quick utility
